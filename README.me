This is the code I have written for the Carleton CS class, Computer Organization & Architecture. 

All of this code is written in assembly, namely MIPS and PAL. Most of this code is written a while ago. All files were sent by my advisor, who has access to the archives. The course description follows. 

Computer processors are extraordinarily complex systems. The fact that they work at all, let alone as reliably as they do, is a monumental achievement of human collaboration. In this course, we will study the structure of computer processors, with attention to digital logic, assembly language, performance evaluation, computer arithmetic, data paths and control, pipelining, and memory hierarchies.
